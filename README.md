# psyscanner

ðŸ§¶ Psychology tests project.

Nothing to do here, yet.
Development in progress. :hammer:\

## `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

## `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
